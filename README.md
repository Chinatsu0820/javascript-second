# javascript-second

This is our second assignment in WD3 - JavaScript for Web Developers 1.

For the second assignment, you need to meet the following conditions with your project:
・Limited Scope Variables: Use the let keyword to declare at least one variable inside of a function (so it is not accessible outside of the function) and use that variable to do something in the function;
・Constant Variables: Use the const keyword to declare at least one constant variable, whose value is never changed, but is used somewhere in the code for some purpose;
・String Manipulation: Use string values somewhere, along with some string manipulation methods to edit the string and/or look for characters or patterns (regular expressions) on the string;
・Built-in Functions: Use at least one built-in function of JavaScript to do something;
・Named Functions: Create at least 3 named functions to do something in your code, ensuring your functions are name well (camel case, avoid names similar to built-in functions and methods, present-tense verbs, etc.);
・Anonymous Function: Use at least one anonymous function somewhere in your code (it can be arrow function but not required, the syntax is up to you);
Return Statement: Employ the return keyword at least once in a function to return a value from the function and use it somewhere else in the code;
・Assignment Operators: Use at least one other assignment operator, besides the basic one (=), somewhere in your code;
・Arithmetic Operators: Use at least two different arithmetic operators somewhere in your code;
・Evaluation / Comparison Operators: Use at least two different comparison operators somewhere in your code;
・Logical Operators: Use at least one logical operator somewhere in your code;
・Conditional Statement: Have at least one conditional statement somewhere in your code, it can be if-else or switch, its up to you. However, regardless of which one you choose, the condition must evaluate to at least two different scenarios, so you must have an ELSE, or two CASE. 
・For Loop: You must make use of a For Loop somewhere in your code.
・While Loop: Have at least one while loop somewhere in your code.
・Arrays: Have and use at least one array somewhere, adding and removing items from it;
・Built-in Class: Make use of at least one built-in Class somewhere in the project;
・Built-in Methods: Make use of at least one built-in method somewhere;
・Constructor: Instantiate at least one instance of an Object, using a built-in Class, either with the new keyword or another approach, and use that Object for something in the project;
・Input-Output: Your project must take user input, and then output something based on that input. Acceptable inputs are: typed into form fields, keys pressed, objects dragged around, drawings made on the screen, uploaded files, or options selected (drop-down, checkbox, etc.). Output can be anything that happens on the webpage due to the input given. In other words, the web app should be interactive.

These conditions are met collectively as a team, so you do not have to individually do all of these things. In the 1st assignment each person coded a mini-app, and each app was independent of each other. This time, you need to make one web-app that is integrated. You have the following options (decide among your team):

Option 1: Re-Use All: Use what each of you did for the 1st assignment, and come up with a way to combine each individual thing into one web-app. For example, if one person did Weather and the other Carousel, you can create a Weather Carousel. Another example, if one person did the Hangman Game and the other a Timer, you can improve the Hangman Game by adding a Timer, and perhaps other things too.
Option 2: Re-Use and Pick New: If you find it difficult to integrate the things you picked, you can decide to re-use one but not the other. For example, if one person picked Carousel and the other Calculator, you can decide to keep the Carousel but add some other feature from the list instead of a Calculator and combine the new pick with the Carousel.
Option 3: Pick New Features: Or you can all pick features from the list that are different from the ones each of you worked on for the 1st assignment, and create something new with those features.

Regardless of which of the options above your team decides to go with, all of your features must be well integrated into one fully functional web app. Grading will be based on the following criteria:

Meeting all the JavaScript requirements listed above;

Demonstrating an understanding of the code you used; - For this, when you present your projects on Thursday, I will ask each team to show where each of the listed requirements is in the code and how its being used. I will ask each team member to describe a requirement from the list at random, so every person need to be familiar with all the code in the project.

Use JavaScript, even if you can achieve your goal with CSS or other things, you must use JavaScript because the goal here is to learn and practice coding with JS
Avoid libraries, frameworks, and plugins; code it with pure JS, do not use external libraries such as jQuery or ReactJS, right now the focus is to study JavaScript in its pure form, without relying on any third party tools
Set up your project on GitHub (pick who will be the host) - and use Git VCS to make commits each time you add new components, sections, features, make updates and fix bugs. Create a branch (along with a remote) for yourself, and push and pull from the main branch as we did in the previous course.
If you hosted the previous assignment, let someone else host this project so that everyone gets to be a host of a team project at least once.
Have fun, practice lots!
